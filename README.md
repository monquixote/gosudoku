# gosudoku

This project is a simple Go program to solve the Sudoku puzzles listed in project Euler 96
https://projecteuler.net/problem=96

It's my first attempt at writing a Sudoku solver and a Go program so it's probably not a shining example of either. 

It expects the file of Sudokus to be in the same format as the project Euler example and to be in the same directory named: "sudoku.txt"
