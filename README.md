# gosudoku

This project is a simple Go program to solve the Sudoku puzzles listed in project Euler 96
https://projecteuler.net/problem=96

It's my first attempt at writing a Sudoku solver and a Go program so it's probably not a shining example of either. 

The project consists of a Sudoku solving library and simple command line application demonstrating use. 

The application takes the path to the file of sudokus as the first argument and expects the file to be in the project Euler format.
